This is the list of Isolator's significant contributors.

This does not necessarily list everyone who has contributed code,
especially since many employees of one corporation may be contributing.
This file was also intended to note several individuals who contributed
to designs and shared code from previous efforts. Their contributions are not
directly captured in Isolator revision history as the designs were converted
to Markdown by the Isolator team (thus original contributors are not shown),
and code from team members previous efforts was added by Isolator team
members. Again, similar to design this then shows Isolator team members
in the revision history. Please note, revision history will accurately
reflect contributions, this information helps provide background information
behind contributors to the initial release.
To see the full list of contributors, see the revision history in
source control.
